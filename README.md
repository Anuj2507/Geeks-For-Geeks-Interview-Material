# Geeks-For-Geeks-Interview-Material
This web crawler saves all the interview experiences for a particular company from GeeksforGeeks website in a PDF format on your PC. Inspired from a similar project I saw on Quora.
Used BeautifulSoup, pdfkit

I have chosen Oracle for this code. You can modify the company as per your need, but it should be there on the website. For more info, refer here. http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/company-interview-corner/

You'll be needing wkhtmltopdf for the conversion. Download here. https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
